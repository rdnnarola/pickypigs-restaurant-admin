                      Having worked in hospitality from a young age, Sasha
                      Miljus, our founder has grown through the changes in
                      legalities, allergens, and dietary trends.
                    </p>
                    <p className="f-15 mb-2">
                      She has a plant based diet, is lactose free and low
                      gluten. Eating out and considering all those things can
                      sometimes be a challenge. However she’s never given up on
                      being a Picky Pig.
                    </p>
                    <p className="f-15 mb-2">
                      Within Sasha's career, she worked for a restaurant group
                      where the worst happened. Due to lack of communication and
                      clarity, a young girl died from an allergic reaction.
                      Picky Pigs was born to ensure nothing like that happened
                      again. With the aim to eliminate as much human error as
                      possible and provide restaurants will a tool to support
                      and protect them.
                    </p>
                    <p className="f-15 mb-2">
                      Picky Pigs means that no one needs to be a "difficult
                      customer" anymore. It means that the guests, the team and
                      the restaurant are supported, transparent and safe.
                    </p>
                    <p className="f-15 mb-0">
                      She wants the control and choice over what she does or
                      doesn't want to put into her body and wants to have
                      confidence in that experience. Picky Pigs means that every
                      guest can have that experience too.
